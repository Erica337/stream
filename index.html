            <h2>What is <span>Streaming</span>?</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>The Definition of streaming</h3>
        <p>Streaming refers to any media content - live or recorded -
            delivered to computers and mobile devices via the
            internet and played back in real time. Podcasts, webcasts,
            movies, TV shows and music videos are common
            forms of streaming content. It is the broadcast of an event over
            the internet. Awards shows, sports, boxing
            matches, video games and special one-time events are the most
            popular types of streaming with an
            ever-growing menu of topics. </p>
        <p>Social media platforms and others broadcast everything from
            celebrity
            vents, promotions and livestreaming to streaming between users.

        <p>Streaming also has impacted us in many ways, such as watching movies for
            entertainment. You donâ€™t have to go to the cinemas to watch your

            Viu or Disney+.</p>

            for example, enabled schools to continue working in the midst of the
            pandemic and serves as an additional source of study material for the
            students. Streaming content helps the people to have an easier access to
            information especially in this time of pandemic, It is also used in business
            matters. In these times many citizens form online businesses, and streaming

        <p>"Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play
            as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures
            around the world. </p>
        <img src="image2.jpg" id="imagestyle1">
        <p>In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking
            or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities,
            each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging
            through kills, deaths, orbs, or spike actions. Every player starts each round with a
            "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability
            charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based
            on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any
            actions taken with the spike. </p>

            guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.
            There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern
            that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. Different agents
            allow players to find more ways to plant the Spike and style on enemies with scrappers,
            strategists, and hunters of every description. It currently offers 16 agents to choose from.

        <h3>The Need of Game Stream Viewers</h3>
        <p>We discussed why many people watch livestream gaming and game reviews. Using the
            methods 5 whys, and What-How-Why, we are able to know that many people stream
            gaming content because of the entertainment of the game and watching their favorite
            gamer do entertaining stuff. The gaming industry and culture has been hugely affected by
            gaming streaming because many people watch and make the game more known and
            popular, especially games that are worldwide</p>
        <h3>Characteristics of A Good Stream</h3>
        <h4>Why is the streamerâ€™s behavior important?</h4>
        <p>Streaming is where we frequently interact to our viewers and audiences whilst sharing thats why it's
            important to note certain behaviors, so what are exactly good behaviors of a good stream? here are the few
            factors to determine this:
        </p>
        <img src="image5.png" id="imagestyle3">
        <p>The most important factor when it comes to streaming is the streamerâ€™s
            behavior. The reasons or motivations why a streamer decides to go live, The obvious goal for some is to
            achieve growth or income. In this situation they mostly stream to have fun and to enjoy themselves. Respect,
            Another one is respecting your audience. This means that to be able to properly say farewell for those who
            donâ€™t want to work with you. Consistency, This is also a big part of the characteristics of a good stream as
            it includes the frequency of streaming, flow of stream content, and good/behavior. A streamer's consistency
            is a big point that ecompasses a lot of aspects of streaming.</p>
        <p>It is also important to control the chat environment while streaming, to remove toxicity in the stream. The
            type of chat environment that cumulates into a stream is ultimately dictated by the streamer and how he/she
            directs the chats. The streamerâ€™s behavior is important because the viewers, especially children, that are
            watching the streamer, might copy the streamerâ€™s behavior or attitude, and if the streamer showed an
            unsightly attitude, then they could be marked as a potential bad influence to the audience.</p>
        <h4>Why is interaction between the audience and the streamer important?</h4>
        <p>Good stream interaction allows viewers to take control of what they want to know during a live streaming
            session. Instead of guessing at what the audience wants, Streamers can use interactive chats, love polls,
            and smart click maps to put the viewers in control and because viewers are an active part of the program,
            they are more apt to remain engaged and learn about a product or service. Another important consideration is
            the chat environment of a streamer as previously mentioned, This can show the bond and how close the
            streamer is from his/her viewers. In a way, you will encounter some that you can not get along with
            regardless of who the streamer is, and
            it is the best if the general chat environment is inclusive.</p>
        <img src="image4.png" id="imagestyle4">
        <p>The interaction between the audience and streamer is important because it shows that the streamer cares for
            its viewers and what they want to see in the current stream or the next stream and also creates a positive
            community between the streamer and audience.
